_Analyzing the internet data of a website for determining exits, views and bounces._


Brief description of features:

	-	Bounces: It represents the percentage of visitors who enter the site and "bounce" (leave the site) rather than continuing to view other pages within the same site.
	-	Exits: It represents the percentage of visitors to a site who actively click away to a different site from a specific page, after possibly having visited any other page on the site.
	-	Continent: It shows the continent from which the site has been accessed.
	-	Source group: It shows how the visitor has accessed the site.
	-	Time on page: It shows how long the user has spent on that particular page of the website.
	-	Unique page view: It represents the number of sessions during which that page was viewed one or more times.
	-	Visits: A visit counts all visitors, no matter how many times the same visitor may have been to your site.
